This folder is for blocked bloom filter implementation, everything is same as bloom filter, 
except it uses multi bit vectors with size 512 bits instead of a single bit vector to record the hash values.

To run this implementation, please run `g++ blockBF.cpp -o bf`, and run R test using the `R_test.r` in the `R_test` folder.\
**PLEASE note that if bit vector size is lower than 512, please run bloom filter implementation instead, this implementation is not for small N **
