#Bloom Filter Implementation
##This folder contains the implementation of Bloom Filter(`BloomFilte.cpp` and `BloomFilter.h`). 
    - To run Bloom Filter, please install g++ if it is not in your machine. example: `g++ BloomFilter.cpp -o bf`
    - There are two main functions in this implementation, which are `build` and `query`
        - To run build function, please run  
        ```
        $bf build -k <key file> -f <fpr> -n <num. distinct keys> -o <output file>
        ``` 
        please provide a `<key file>`, which contains `<num. distinct keys>` distinct input keys, 
        and construct a bloom filter with a target false positive rate of `<fpr>`.  
        The constructed Bloom filter should be written to the file `<output file>`.
    


`R_test` folder is used for testing the performance, Please run this
